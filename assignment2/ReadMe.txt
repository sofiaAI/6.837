• How do you compile and run your code? Specify which OS you have tested on.

I am on macOS and I use VSCode

• Did you collaborate with anyone in the class? If so, let us know who you talked to and what sort of help you gave or received.

Tony Berrones helped me figure out math for subspace formation 

• Were there any references (books, papers, websites, etc.) that you found particularly helpful for completing your assignment? Please provide a list. In particular, mention if you borrowed the model(s) used as your artifact from somewhere.
I did not use external references 

• Are there any known problems with your code? If so, please provide a list and, if possible, describe what you think the cause is and how you might fix them if you had more time or motivation. This is very important, as we’re much more likely to assign partial credit if you help us understand what’s going on.

One part of my mesh is attached to the wrong location, so the left hand looks elongated. I am pretty sure the issue comes from LoadAttachmentWeights. I believe it is an issue with indices, but I have run out of time to fix the issue. Other than this, everything works as expected

• Did you do any of the extra credit? If so, let us know how to use the additional features. If there was a substantial amount of work involved, describe how you did it.

No


• Do you have any comments about this assignment that you’d like to share? We know this was a tough one, but did you learn a lot from it? Or was it overwhelming?

It was pretty fun
