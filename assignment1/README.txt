How do you compile and run your code? Specify which OS you have tested on.

I am on macOS and I use VSCode

• Did you collaborate with anyone in the class? If so, let us know who you talked to and what sort of help you gave or received.

I collaborated with Tony Berrones. We brainstormed together and I received help on the patches because he got the chance to go to office hours 

• Were there any references (books, papers, websites, etc.) that you found particularly helpful for completing your assignment? Please provide a list. In particular, mention if you borrowed the model(s) used as your artifact from somewhere.

The models I used came from https://github.com/bbrrck/geo-num-2016/tree/master/TP6/data

• Are there any known problems with your code? If so, please provide a list and, if possible, describe what you think the cause is and how you might fix them if you had more time or motivation. This is very important, as we’re much more likely to assign partial credit if you help us understand what’s going on.

No known problems! Hopefully no problems at all

• Did you do any of the extra credit? If so, let us know how to use the additional features. If there was a substantial amount of work involved, describe how you did it.

No time for extra credit this week... the pset itself was enough

• Do you have any comments about this assignment that you’d like to share? We know this was a tough one, but did you learn a lot from it? Or was it overwhelming?

While I did learn, I certainly was overwhelmed. Nobody expects to take a late day on the first pset ahah. I hope that this is one of the more difficult sets overall. I think the assignment could have used a smidge more guidance.
